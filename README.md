## 📁 Dataset

The dashboard loads data directly from Google Drive using shared public links. These data are the data that i already process and i put in Google Drive:

- **[cleaned_data.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_zEIUvWkEo53Ejzdr4zhB4O8U76vhMmN/view?usp=sharing)**: Transaction-level sales data 
- **[rfm_segment.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lhBDx7Wk_6btlPQ4b1K80ZvQRJ0XaF8G/view?usp=sharing)**: Pre-processed RFM segmentation results

But for the analysis process, i get the data from kaggle dataset by an author Laura Fink, here's the original link:
